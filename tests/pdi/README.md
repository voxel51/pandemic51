# Physical distancing index (PDI) tests

Compute object counts by executing the script:

```

The script outputs `eta.core.images.ImageLabels` to `out/labels` and annotated
images with the predictions overlaid to `out/anno`.

Plot the outputs of the above script by running the following script:

```py
python plot_pdis.py
```
